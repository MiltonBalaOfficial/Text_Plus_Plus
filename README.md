# Text⁺⁺

Insert Text with special characters like greek letters, superscripts, subscripts and other symbols. It also works with existing text. You can also make your text 'rotation enabled'!

## Installation Steps

1. **Place the folder** (`The Plugin folder`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\xournalpp\plugins\` on Windows 
     *Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.*
   - `~/.config/xournalpp/plugins` on Linux or MacOS

1. **Place the icons** (`provided icons(if any)`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\share\icons\hicolor\scalable\actions` on Windows,
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/` on Linux or MacOS

2. **In the Xournal++ app**:
  Open menu `View > Toolbars > Customize`(stable version) `Edit > Toolbars > Customize`(Nightly version). You will find the copied icons in the `Plugins` section. Place them at a suitable location in the toolbar. (make sure the version of your Xournalapp support Plugin icons)

3. **Use the plugin** as needed


## Directions

1. **Easy Text Insertion**:  
   - Run the plugin and start typing directly into the plugin’s input field.  
   - The text will appear at the visible location of the plugin window.  
   - To insert text elsewhere, move the plugin window to the desired position.  
   - If the plugin window is not fully visible (e.g., due to text alignment being too far to the right), adjust the window's position to the desired position and toggle **Set Position** on. Once the text is inserted, it will appear in your chosen position.

2. **Normal or Rotation-Enabled Text**:  
   - After finishing, you can insert the text as either **normal text** or **rotation-enabled text**.  

3. **Editing Existing Text**:  
   - To edit an existing text layer with special characters, select the text and then run the plugin.  
   - If you’re actively typing with the text tool, you can still use the plugin to edit. The plugin will automatically pull the current text.  
   - **Note**: When the plugin starts, your existing text will be temporarily deleted. However, if you close the plugin without inserting anything, the original text will reappear.  

4. **Rotation-Enabled Text**:  
   - If you want rotation-enabled text, the plugin can create it. Currently, this works for regular characters and a limited set of special characters.  
   - Keep in mind that rotation-enabled text will not behave as standard text anymore—it will be converted to **Text Stroke**.

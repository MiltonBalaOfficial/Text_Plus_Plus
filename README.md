# Text⁺⁺

Insert Text with special characters like greek letters, superscripts, subscripts and other symbols. It also works with existing text. You can also make your text 'rotation enabled'!

## Installation Steps

1. **Place the folder** (`The Plugin folder`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\xournalpp\plugins\` on Windows 
     *Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.*
   - `~/.config/xournalpp/plugins` on Linux or MacOS

1. **Place the icons** (`provided icons(if any)`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\share\icons\hicolor\scalable\actions` on Windows,
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/` on Linux or MacOS

2. **In the Xournal++ app**:
  Open menu `View > Toolbars > Customize`(stable version) `Edit > Toolbars > Customize`(Nightly version). You will find the copied icons in the `Plugins` section. Place them at a suitable location in the toolbar. (make sure the version of your Xournalapp support Plugin icons)

3. **Use the plugin** as needed


## Direction of Use

1. Easy to use, after running the plugin type with the keyboard and insert special characters into the input field.
2. Once you are done insert the text as normal text or as rotation enabled text.
3. If you edit the existing text to add special character to that, just select the text and run the plugin. If you want to edit text with this plugin while typing with `text` tool just run the plugin while typing, plugin will take the text automatically.
4. If you want your text as rotation enabled, you can also do that. Till now this functionality only works only for normal characters and a few special characters. Keep in mind that the 'rotation enabled text' will not be normal text anymore, it will become Text Stroke!
